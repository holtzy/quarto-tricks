It is pretty easy to insert an interactive table in your quarto doc thanks to the DT table.

Start by installing the package with `install.packages("DT")`

Then load the package in your doc:

```{r}
library(DT)
```

Then you just have to pass a dataframe to the `datatable()` function:\

```{r}
# load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Make a table
datatable(iris,
  filter = "top",
)

```
