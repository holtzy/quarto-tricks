Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

Note that you can also make it a bit more personal using `css`

:::{.callout-gradient}
:::{.callout-note}
This is a custom callout. 

Using CSS, you can control pretty much everything.

This div is even shaking every now and then ðŸ™ƒ
