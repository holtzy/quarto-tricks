Sometimes code just takes too much space on the doc.\
\
This is even more true if readers most likely don't know how to read it.\
\
In this case, you can hide code chunks, and display a small button to show them if needed.

Let's do it! The chart for this code is hidden.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Flipper Length vs Body Mass by Species",
         x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
         y = "Body Mass (g)") +
    theme_minimal()
```
